The topic of this course is PCPs, with emphasis on their applications in hardness of approximation. 

It is firmly believed that the class of NP-hard problems does not admit polynomial time algorithms. For some NP-hard problems, the task of finding an approximation algorithm, that is, an algorithm that finds a solution which is "close" to the optimum, remains NP-hard. Such results are known as hardness of approximation results, and proving such statements requires a fundamental TCS result known as the PCP theorem. This theorem has its origins in proof systems, has close connections to optimization, combinatorics, Fourier analysis and more, and has wide array of applications throughout TCS. 

In this course, we will present the theory of PCPs, prove some fundamental consequences of it as well as more recent advances. More specifically, the first half of the course will be devoted to the (algebraic) proof of the basic PCP theorem and basic relation to approximation problems. We will then move on to more advanced topics, such as hardness amplification, the long-code framework, the Unique-Games Conjecture and its implications, and the 2-to-2 Games theorem. 

 

Lectures: Tuesday & Thursday, 11:00 - 12:30 EST, room 4-145.

**Grading** 

There will be 3-5 problem sets during the course, and the final grade in the course will be an average of your grade in the problem sets. 

***Starred and non-starred problems:*** 

The problem sets will contain problems of normal difficulty, as well as more challenging problems that will be marked with a star (\*). Solving all normal difficulty problems is enough in order to get an A-, but to get an A or A+ requires solving a substantial number of starred problems. 

***Collaboration:*** 

(1) You are highly encouraged to think about and solve the problems by your own. However, discussing the problems is allowed within reason (i.e. not just sharing your solutions). In any case of collaboration, please mention in your submission the names of people that you have collaborated with, individually for each problem. 

(2) You may not look up solutions to homework problems online or offline. 

***Submission*** 

(1) Solutions to problem sets are to be typed in LATEX and submitted as a PDF file. Please name your file as ps#\_Lastname\_Firstname.pdf, and remember to include your name in each file. 

(2) The submission deadline for each problem set will be mentioned in the problem set itself. Late submission will result in penalized score of 20% reduction per day. That is, a submission late in 2 days that is graded x points will actually be given 0.6 x points. No fractional reductions.
